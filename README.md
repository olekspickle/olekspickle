I am called many things but among other I am:
- **backend** engineer (cli, api)
- **rendering** and 👾 **game** enthusiast (shaders, Rust, wgpu, opengl)
- 🕸️a bit of a **web** developer (React, Angular, Node, Typescript)🕸️
- worked with substrate(node runtime, pallets) and ethereum(event mapping, thegraph).

- procedural animations

Or backend developer:
- REST, GraphQL
- Docker, k8s, GCP, AWS
